# tfs-emojis
Emojis that work in Microsoft Visual Studio Team Foundation Server

## Background
When using emojis in TFS they do not always render. The [documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/project/wiki/markdown-guidance?view=azure-devops#emoji) states that **The full set of emojis are supported.**. But this is not entirely true. Many does not work. This is a curated list of emojis that actually work in TFS.
